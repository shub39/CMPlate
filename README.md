The goal is to have a KMP project template with all the knowledge I have gathered 
so that I start working on a project in the morning and ship it by evening.

- Web via kotlin/wasm (only for previews)

### Libraries (besides android and Jetbrains stuff)
- Splashscreen for android
- Kotlinx Serialization Json
